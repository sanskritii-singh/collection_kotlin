# collection_kotlin
Practicing different types of collection in a project using kotlin language

Imagine you are creating a forum for coders in a programming community. In that forum, the user can create a post. For instance, they may talk in their post about their code or projects. Other coders in that forum can choose a comment to add to that post.  In addition, the users can choose a relationship type. This indicates the relationship between one user and another. These are relationship types such as ‘work colleague’, ‘friend’ or being a member of the same sports team. Finally, you will include the ability for the author of a post to block other users from commenting on the post.
